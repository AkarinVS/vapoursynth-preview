Preview for VapourSynth scripts. Meant to be paired with code editor like VS Code.

# Prerequisites

Python 3.7
Vapoursynth R45

pip modules:
`pyqt5 qdarkstyle pyyaml pysubs2 vapoursynth`

# Usage

`py run.py script.vpy` where `script.vpy` is VapourSynth script.

# Note

WIP, so there're some debug stuff among the logic, but not much. 'Test' button is the only trace of debug in UI.

# Development

pip modules:
pyqt5-stubs mypy pycodestyle pylint

PyQt5 stubs may be incomplete when it comes to signals.
